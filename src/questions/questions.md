## In the illustration, let’s imagine I know the whole Merkle tree. Someone gives me L2 data block but I don’t trust him. How can I check if L2 data is valid?

## I know only the L3 block and the Merkle root. What minimum information do I need to check that the L3 block and the Merkle root belong to the same Merkle tree?

## What are some Merkle tree use cases?
